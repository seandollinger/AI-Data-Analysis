Sentiment Classifier using Anthropic Claude API or Open AI
This repository contains a Python script that classifies the sentiment of text as either positive or negative using Anthropic's Claude language model or Opeo AI. The script allows you to input a piece of text, which is then analyzed by the model, returning a sentiment classification.

Features
Sentiment Classification: The model analyzes input text and classifies it as either 'positive' or 'negative.'
Command-line Interface: Simple CLI to input text for classification.
Anthropic API Integration: Utilizes the Claude language model for natural language understanding and sentiment analysis.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.7 or higher
Anthropic API key (replace your_anthropic_api_key_here with your actual key)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-classifier.git
cd sentiment-classifier
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install anthropic argparse
Set up your Anthropic API key by replacing the placeholder in the code with your actual key:

python
client = anthropic.Client(api_key='your_anthropic_api_key_here')
Usage
To classify the sentiment of a piece of text, run the following command:

bash
python sentiment_classifier.py "Your text to classify here"
For example:

bash
python sentiment_classifier.py "This is an amazing day!"
This will output:

Copy code
positive
Code Structure
create_prompt(text): Prepares the input prompt for the language model with the text to classify.
call_llm(prompt): Sends the prompt to Anthropic's Claude model and retrieves the response.
argparse: Command-line argument parsing to handle user input.
